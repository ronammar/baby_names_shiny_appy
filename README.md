# Baby names Shiny app

A Shiny app for stats about baby names from the [US Social Security Administration](http://michaeltoth.me/popularity-of-baby-names-since-1880.html).

This is an effort to reproduce and modify the [blog post by Michael Toth](http://michaeltoth.me/popularity-of-baby-names-since-1880.html) ([code](https://github.com/michaeltoth/shiny-projects/tree/master/census_names)).

My main objective is to create an app to help people find baby names. I want to streamline some of the aspects from Toth's blog post to make it quicker to compare male and female and perhaps add some trend-finding logic (eg. which names were wildly popular years ago, but have fallen out of favor, such as *Ron*).
